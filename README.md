# ðŸ‘€ Why DeepDubber?

<font align="left" size="3">
  <ul>
    <li>Sometimes, we need to quickly dub a video in another language.</li>
    <li>DeepDubber automatically generates subtitles, translates it to another language and then adds it to the video.</li>
  </ul>
</font>

# Usage
Using is very easy, just follow the steps below:

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dhravya/deepdubber.git
```

Install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run src/main.py (Make sure to change the path to your video, and feel free to configure as you want.):

```bash
python ./src/main.py
```

I've only tested this on Windows, but it should work on linux and MacOS too.

And now, sit back and enjoy the magic! âœ¨
